# Linker
## Your open-source one-stop solution to find Broken Links on deployed Pages!

Welcome to Linker! 

We are a team of 3 devs:

Linker is an open-source chrome extension designed to grab all broken links on the page you're running the extension on, and either E-mail them to you or show them as a chrome alert. When you click on the extension, you get the option to get either of the aforementioned methods.

Our target audience is primarily web-developers. This extension is a developer tool that users can use to quickly perform final link checks instead of checking every single link individually.

## Using the Linker chrome extension
-> Click on the extension icon  
  
-> If you want the broken links in your E-mail, enter your e-mail and click on the first button. Else, click on the second button.   
  
-> Wait for 30s to 1 minute for all the links to be parsed and checked. 

## How to run the extension locally?

1. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`.
    - Alternatively, open this page by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
3. Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory.

Ta-da! The extension has been successfully installed.
