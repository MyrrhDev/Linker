# Linker
## Your open-source one-stop solution to finding Broken Links on deployed Pages!

Welcome to Linker! 

We are a team of 3 devs:

Linker is an open-source chrome extension designed to grab all broken links (including 404s) on the page you're running the extension on, and either E-mail them to you or show them as a chrome alert. When you click on the extension, you get the option to get either of the aforementioned methods.

Our target audience is primarily web-developers. This extension is a developer tool that users can use to quickly perform final link checks instead of checking every single link individually.

## Using the Linker chrome extension
-> Click on the extension icon  
  
-> If you want the broken links in your E-mail, enter your e-mail and click on the first button. Else, click on the second button.   
  
-> Wait for 30s to 1 minute for all the links to be parsed and checked.
